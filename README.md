I love re-imagining what the future could look like; what the future *should* look like. That's always my starting point, and then I like to work backwards to understand what innovations are going to get us there.

Over the past six years, I have spent a lot of time learning, thinking and doing across three thematic areas that I find wonderfully interesting:

1.	Economic systems and the allocation of capital
2.	Sustainable solutions to creating social impact
3.	Innovative technology that can be used to deliver democratic, scalable solutions

I am now looking to join a dynamic and ambitious organisation that gives me the opportunity to harness my skill set across finance, social impact, and tech and to help build something that I believe is the absolute bees knees.

### Skills

##### Problem-solver

I like challenging the status quo, I like innovating, I like start-ups.

That's why I took the leap to leave a successful career and learn how to code at Makers Academy, a 16-week, supercharged, coding bootcamp. For me, programming is problem solving at its absolute best. Continuous iterations of decomposition, debugging, pattern recognition with heaps of room for creativity and thoughtful design. The last three months have affirmed three self-truths: I love learning, I really enjoy making things and I'm becoming ever more comfortable being outside of my comfort zone.

##### Collaborator

I enjoy understanding different people's motivators and aligning a team around a shared goal.

I have worked in both large and small organisations; developed strategy within purely commercial businesses and purely impact-driven businesses; spent significant time understanding communities in both the developed and emerging worlds. I believe that this variety of experience equips me with a unique lens to be able to connect and engage a multitude of stakeholders from different walks of life, with different motivations towards a common purpose.

##### Connector

I'm good at joining the dots - be it people, networks, or ideas. I believe the most exciting things happen at the intersection of different disciplines.

Over the years, I have been lucky enough to both work with and learn from some really bright and talented folks across finance, social enterprise and now tech and I continue to actively contribute to those networks. My 'match-making' has sown the seeds of some interesting collaborations, including a social enterprise venture co-founded by two friends, a new board member for a classmate's startup, a marriage, a fashion show that raised Â£30K for charity and most importantly, a multitude of unlikely friendships.

##### Porpoiser

I'm adept at both big picture strategy and detail-oriented execution.

Five years of investing in capital markets taught me the fine art of continuously balancing tactical and strategic thinking.

(In case you were wondering, porpoises are aquatic marine mammals that swim through the water with undulatory locomotion.)
